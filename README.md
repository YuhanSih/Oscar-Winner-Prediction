# Oscar Prediction Project Description

## Topic
The research topic is to explore the factors that contribute to a film’s success at the Academy Awards and to predict Oscar winners.

## Existing Research
Ben Zauzmer created an Oscar dataset and a mathematical model to predict the winners of the Oscars. In the book "Oscarmetrics: The Math Behind the Biggest Night in Hollywood," he researched every category of the Oscars using his mathematical model to answer questions such as: Does box office success lead to Oscar wins? Does runtime affect the Oscars? Do the Oscars align with critics and audiences? (Zauzmer, 2019).

Interestingly, Zauzmer did not include box office performance in his model for any category when predicting the Oscars. He argued that the data does not demonstrate a significant impact of box office receipts on Oscar results. This book was published before the pandemic; does this conclusion still hold after the pandemic? During the pandemic, did the Oscars consider films with high box office revenue? This year, Zauzmer also wrote an article for The Hollywood Reporter to predict the Oscars, stating that the models he used have been adjusted over time (Zauzmer, 2023).

The website GoldDerby is a platform for enthusiasts and industry professionals interested in tracking and discussing award ceremonies. It provides predictions from entertainment industry experts, critics, and journalists, offering insights into the potential winners of upcoming awards. For the 2024 Oscars, Jacob Sarkisian predicted that we could have all five nominees in that field go to biopics for the first time in Oscars history. He stated that one of the most obvious and long-standing Oscar trends of all time is that Academy Awards voters prefer "actors and actresses turning in transformative performances, altering their voices, and donning makeup and wigs to play a real-life person" (Sarkisian). I plan to test this claim in the research.


## Research Questions
1. Most people believe that if an actor or actress wins both the Screen Actors Guild(SAG) and a Golden Globe, they will also win the Oscar. Is this consistently true throughout Oscar history? If there are exceptions, what are the reasons?

2. In recent years, there has been a noticeable increase in the number of biographical films nominated or winning Oscars. Does the Academy have a preference for this genre? Furthermore, who is more likely to win an Oscar when starring in a biographical film, actors or actresses?

3. In 2015, all twenty Oscar nominees in the acting categories were white. Consequently, activist April Reign launched the #OscarsSoWhite social media campaign to critique Hollywood’s racial discrimination. How did this movement influence subsequent Oscar nominations? Have political and social factors played an increasing role in Oscar selections?

## Research Methods
To explore the relationship between winning the Screen Actors Guild award and a Golden Globe with winning an Oscar, I will collect data including award winners and instances where actors or actresses won both the SAG and Golden Globe but did not win an Oscar. Subsequently, I will examine exceptions and investigate the reasons for these anomalies.

For the second question, the research will collect data on the genres of nominated and winning films, with a specific focus on biographical films. Statistical analysis and trend examination will be employed to identify patterns. Additionally, I will calculate the proportion of actors and actresses who have won Oscars for biographical films.

To explore the impact of the #OscarsSoWhite movement on subsequent Oscar nominations, the research will collect data on the racial background of nominees and calculate the proportion of people of color among Oscar acting nominees each year. This study will focus on whether the proportion of people of color among Oscar nominees has increased since 2015, thus evaluating the impact of this movement on the Oscars.

## Datasets
This folder contains the data for the prediction of Oscar winners. The data is not complete yet and will be updated later.

The `oscars.csv` was created by Raphael Fontes and David Lu which can be found on [GitHub here](https://github.com/DLu/oscar_data/blob/main/oscars.csv). 
This dataset includes information about Oscar nominees and winners from the 1st to the 95th Academy Awards. Here is the list of the variables and a brief description:

| `Year` | Year(s) from which the films are honored | string |
| `Class` | A custom broad grouping for categories. Values include: Title, Acting, Directing, Music, Production, SciTech and Special | string |
| `CanonicalCategory` | Removes the variations on the exact wording of the category name over the years | string |
| `Category` | The precise category name according to Oscars.org | string |
| `NomId` | Unique string representing the IMDb Nomination ID | uuid |
| `Film` | The title of the film (optional) | string |
| `FilmId` | Unique string representing the IMDb Title ID | uuid |
| `Name` | The precise text used for who is being nominated | string |
| `Nominees` | The names of who is nominated in a comma separated list (without any extra text like "Written by") | comma separated strings |

| `Note` | Additional information provided about the award/nomination | string |
| `Citation` | Official text of the award statement, for Scientific/Technical/Honorary awards | sring |
| `MultifilmNomination` | Generally the data is one nomination per row, but for certain early nominations (Ceremonies 1, 2, 3 & 8), people were nominated for multiple films, and so one nomination could be spread over multiple rows | bool |


According to this dataset, Mate Varadi compiled data for predicting the Oscars, incorporating additional variables that may influence Oscar votes. The dataset includes the six Oscar awards people are most concerned about: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Supporting Actor. He added variables encompassing Genre, MPAA rating, IMDB score, Rotten Tomatoes Critics and Audience scores, total number of nominations, number of previous nominations and wins, as well as the nominations and results of Oscar precursor award ceremonies, including BAFTA, Golden Globe, Critics Choice Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, Directors Guild of America Award, and Producers Guild of America Award. The original data can be [found here](https://github.com/MateVaradi/OscarPrediction/tree/main/data). I selected datasets covering Oscar winners from 1961 to 2022, see `oscardata_acting.csv`, `oscardata_bestdirector.csv` and `oscardata_bestpicture.csv`.
